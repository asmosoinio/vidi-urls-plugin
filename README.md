# Vidi URLs Plugin

Quick, relevant links to Vidispine from within Portal.


## ToDo
* Create install script to put the HTML into the base template (and metadatamanagement template)
* Add ability to close / hit urls (if they obscure something)

## Bugs
* /vs/index/ and /search/last/10/ do not hit the plugin
* Stop part matches e.g. /user/ is matched with /user/admin/
